<p>&#8220;It was tall, yet not so tall as it seemed, because it didn't stand on the floor, but hovered with its feet a foot or more above the floor. Its feet&mdash;it had feet, but I don't know what their shape was. They had no shape, just as the thing's legs and torso, arms and hands, head and face, had no shape, no fixed form. They writhed, swelling and contracting, stretching and shrinking, not greatly but without pause. An arm drifted into the body, was swallowed by the body, came out again as if poured out. The nose stretched down over the gaping shapeless mouth, shrank back up into the face till it was flush with the pulpy cheeks, grew out again. Eyes spread until they were one gigantic eye that blotted out the whole upper face, diminished until there was no eye, and opened in their places again. The legs were now one leg like a twisting, living pedestal, and then three, and then two. No feature or member ever stopped twisting, quivering, writhing long enough for its average outline, its proper shape, to be seen. The thing was a thing like a man who floated above the floor, with a horrible grimacing greenish face and pale flesh that was not flesh, that was visible in the dark, and that was as fluid and as unresting and as trasparent as tidal water.&#8221;</p>

<p>suffer under cruelty or induce a delayed but more focused cruelty. construct this situation which will lead to your own bondage.</p>
<p>this grain is not grainy, per se, rather it is quite stringy. it does look grainy from the right angle, though.</p>

<h2>12 10 2003 | a personal narrative</h2>
<p>if you're in the next band, you better fucking bring it or i'm going to jump up there and kick your ass.</p>

<h2>11 20 2003 | it's going to be so fun</h2>
<p>there's a bunch of you in the water, but the property line is way over there. now there's a lizard on a stick by my face. now he's on my face. why is my dad wearing a moo moo?</p>

<h2>11 02 2003 | lone wolf and cub</h2>
<p>in the old west; riding street bikes through a town in the desert, but on the beach. a man with a moustache removes the &#8220;bottom safety spoke&#8221; from my front wheel.</p>
<p>there is also a hand cart.</p>

<h2>10 16 2003 | just a few too late</h2>
<p>in the classroom i had a gun and some marijuana. a police officer came in. i left for the bathroom to dispose of the above noted items. he caught up with me before i got there, but i somehow got away. i slid down steep hills covered in grass.</p>

<p>i was in another country, near the ocean. sometimes i would try to surf, but the waves went from the beach out to sea, and i would be swept up in them. i learned from the tv or somewhere else that the world trade center had been destroyed by airplanes. i thought about how groundwork books had moved to the top of a similar building in new york; one where tv broadcast from as well. a few days later, i learned that their building was on fire too. it lasted longer, but soon we got no more news. someone from groundwork said it was probably better that way anyhow.</p>

<p>oh, that's dirty too.</p>
<p>&#8220;i don't have the prerequisites, and i abhor ruben.&#8221;</p>
<p>yeah, that didn't happen. nor that. or that. or that. or that. or even that.</p>

<h2>08 18 2003 | rubbing chips on eyes</h2>
<p>there was this miniature one &amp; a painful one whose mouthpiece rested temporarily on extremities.</p>
<p>up side; down. front side; back. forth and back and forth. and finally, twisted curled, tilting up, encircling and containing.</p>

<h2>08 02 2003 | online diaries are a terrible idea</h2>
<p>because people read them.</p>

<h2>06 24 2003 | this was supposed to have a title</h2>
<p>&#8220;Western philosophy is founded on religion as a system of social conformity to create the perpetual state. Asian philosophy is founded on struggle for perfection of personal individuality; there's no concept of original sin, no dialectic thinking, no social contracts. In Asian philosophy, you would never give up the individual to the state; that's sissy philosophy. Western philosophy says we' re all losers and sinners and victims. In Chinese philosophy, we're all soldiers; if we're not fighting for personal integrity, then we deserve to be victims, we deserve to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>not very fucking deep apparently.</p>
<p>it goes without saying that there was a great deal of joy involved in the entire transaction, and despite weeks between meetings, things were very successful overall. indeed, the dynamic of the situation was relatively smooth, and the final product far outdistanced the original.</p>

<p>apparently they don't laugh this much all the time. she's not used to getting laughed at. and she (the little one) is very inventive. i was not as skilled at this as one might have guessed.</p>
<p>when you're tired beyond belief, and you're so sick it feels like your sinuses are going to burst out of your eyes, and you're sunburned on your mouth, the best thing to do is to drink a lot, because then you won't feel any of that shit anymore.</p>
<p>the math final was either (a) ridiculously difficult or (b) about average, but i was too delirious to answer ANY OF THE FUCKING QUESTIONS RIGHT. yeah.</p>

<h2>06 12 2002 | your floating head is awfully cute</h2>
<p>when there are tens of you stuck all about, it doesn't much hinder the overall interest or attractiveness. and although the lechon itself is a bit of a terrible idea, it's gorgeous as well. i must ask you not to try the avacado shake.</p>

<h2>05 29 2002 | well we're going to have to think about this.</h2>
<p>what the fuck is so hard about talking about it now? why stifle every semi-involved or semi-interesting conversation that comes up? blah.</p>
<p>say, it's five days after the deadline, do i have everything? no. oh yeah, i should have expected that. how lovely.</p>

<h2>05 13 2002 | what's going on here maxie?</h2>
<p>as luck would have it, every single class that i could possibly desire to take next quarter has been scheduled at the same time. needing to take four classes per quarter, every quarter, until the end of my 5th year in order to graduate, i must now attempt to enroll in classes that i do not desire to take.</p>

<h2>05 05 2002 | cinco de NO FUCKING ARTICLES</h2>
<p>as usual, there is a substantial number of new indicator articles that have not yet been turned in. you are so fucking dead.</p>
<p>test painting for larger painting. green blue at the moment. a little black. there will be white &amp; red &amp; yellow later.</p>
<p>p.s. hart css!</p>


<h2>05 04 2002 | see you later, tiger</h2>
<p>sam raimi is my new hero. the first movie based on a comic book that did it any justice at all! i am so happy! how many phallic references and bits of ultra-cheesy dialog can you fit into a hollywood film? i didn't keep count. go see spider-man. sweet jesus. we did consume a lot of ice cream and some alcohol, though, so maybe you should too.</p>
<p>you should pay more attention to the technical side of things. knowing how to do all of those little tech things and being able to relate them to other people will make your life so much easier on the whole. that's one thing i like in people. self-responsibility. yeah.</p>

<h2>05 03 2002 | excel spreadsheet</h2>
<p>
&#8220;hey kellen, could you design a form for us?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;sure, what's it for? what do you want it to look like?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;it's an information technology request form. we want it to look like this.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;oh.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;do you think you could improve it?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;of course. what format do you want it in?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;we'd like it in pdf so it can be availible on the web.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;okay, i can do that.&#8221;<br />
&#8230;<br />
&#8220;hey! i finished that form you wanted. it's in pdf and it's fillable on the web and everything!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;uh, thanks.&#8221;<br />
&#8230;<br />
&#8220;kellen, we took what you did in pdf and duplicated it in excel.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;alright, why?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;well we just decided to.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;okay&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;so now we need some changes made to it. could you do that for us?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;i guess&#8230; i don't really know how excel works though.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;great! thanks a lot! make sure you fix the tab order and the print areas and the cell sizes.&#8221;<br />

<p>she got free beer but all it did was make us tired. and it made us hope it was a crucifix that was broken, not just that little candle holder.</p>

<h2>04 22 2002 | didn't drink</h2>
<p>21st birthday on the 21st! little alcohol &amp; silly music &amp; fantastic map books &amp; secret pies! everything was quite lovely. i am happy.</p>
<p>i bit my cheek the other day, and so i had a hole in my cheek. then it got sort of swollen, because there was a hole. then i bit it again, because it was in the way of my teeth, so it got more swollen. and now it makes me want to just cut off my cheek completely.</p>

<h2>04 20 2002 | a gig up in la</h2>
<p>you realize, of course, that if you don't wake up when your alarm goes off, you won't be able to meet the obligations that you've made that have a reliance upon the time of day at which they occur, for which?</p>
<p>no wonder the fuckin' computers don't work right. you keep installing filesharing programs on them.</p>

<h2>04 19 2002 | right up until the last minute.</h2>
<p>total fucking exhaustion &amp; there are too many things to do.</p>

<h2>04 17 2002 | i can feel you in my stomach again</h2>
<p>twenty straight hours programming a little app to do file compression based on the huffman encoding tree&#8230; and it didn't even work. what a shame that is. the result of all this is a massive headache, puffy eyes, a sore back, throbbing teeth, and a nasty bit of hunger to boot.</p>
<p>something odd happens about 4:30am. the light starts to change and some people start to wake up and drive their cars to work. the birds wake up, too, and they greet the morning playfully. i usually find myself staring at the sky&#8211;it looks like watercolors gone awry. it's getting lighter, but the sky doesn't care.</p> 

<h2>04 13 2002 | living with you is like living in a living nightmare.</h2>
<p>we're walking against breast cancer&#8230; and we're driving the pimp-mobile!</p>
<p>books reclaimed from grandmother's garage:<br />math: 4<br />sociology: 4<br />science: 6<br />computer science: 11<br />political science: 5<br />fiction: 24<br />physical education for elementary school: 1</p>

<h2>04 12 2002 | without you</h2>
<p>i dreamt&#8230;</p>
<p>someone close to me had killed this woman. i was somehow responsible for disposing of her body. i wrapped it inside a sweatshirt and placed it in a locker at the beach. i went to a hotel, where i had to make a quick escape from an elevator. someone broke into the locker and found the body. i ended up in someone's car. they went to a sort of drive-thru theater which was showing video of this woman being killed. i layed down in the back.</p>
<p>i was very scared the entire time.</p>

<h2>04 11 2002 | he tried out for a porno</h2>
<p>non-deterministic finite automaton. yay for that.</p>
<p>a return to the che, for a bit, proved fairly uncomfortable and inefficient, as i had expected. it seems silly that things are done like that.</p>
<p>there is this pain in what i guess is a muscle running from my lower left back into my leg. it is affected when i tilt my head down, stretch my leg out straight, or otherwise elongate it. i hate it. yoga, perhaps.</p>

<h2>04 09 2002 | triple scalar product</h2>
<p>at one point, it wasn't so hard to do this math. at one point it was actually very intuitive and therefore easy and therefore not even a concern. today, however, this math wasn't so intuitive. it was frustrating precisely because of that.</p>
<p>tomorrow morning there will be pancakes again. and maybe this time they won't have too much applesauce so that they can be fully cooked, but still moist, and maybe, if i'm lucky, a light toasty brown.</p>

<h2>04 07 2002 | hetero-middle-class-white-male</h2>
<p>you can cook for your neighbor, or cook a dog for your neighbor, or just cook your neighbor. there is very little distinction between any of the above listed options.</p>
<p>"just tell me you're making a bookcase and it'll all be over."</p>
<p>your water bill is $121. you use, on average, 348 gallons of water per day. pay us now.</p>

<h2>04 05 2002 | there is too much applesauce in the pancakes</h2>
<p>the art of the faculty of the university of california, san diego can be described in relatively few words. one of them is "bad" and another is "bad".</p>
<p>&#8220;you are very advanced for someone who doesn't talk to people&#8221;</p>
<p>you should build your tree from the leaves up, so that you have the most optimized tree possible. then your search time, on average, will be the most efficient. horray for huffman</p>

<h2>04 02 2002 | ho&#8211;ly shit</h2>
<p>how do you explain collages &amp; polaroids &amp; dishes &amp; parks &amp; film &amp; deserts &amp; skies?</p>
<p>breakfast with family led to many opportunities to spout propaganda &amp; criticisms of their lifestyles &amp; request guns. if i only had that bike&#8230;</p>
<p>did i mention that everything is wonderful?</p>

<h2>03 24 2002 | all the swingin' monkeys in the trees have their vines</h2>
<p>this evening was all about the trees and the dark and the cold crisp air and the taste of ale and the smiles in my head. there are times when it's really hard to stop smiling.</p>

<h2>03 23 2002 | the blanket drag</h2>
<p>grin. there is a green shirt and a pink tie.</p>
<p>the fucking dog is jumping all over things, shedding in the cranberry juice glass, trying to eat donuts &amp; coffee. i hate it.</p>

<h2>03 21 2002 | it could have been better</h2>
<p>.section ".data", .section ".text", .global, mov, st, %l0-%l7, dl, subcc, bne,a</p>
<p>stop it.</p>
<p>it could have been a lot better, if it wasn't inside, poorly lit, squandered on study, protected from breezes, sheilded from water sun dirt animals. should have been snuggled close, watching closely.</p>

<h2>03 20 2002 | very nice</h2>
<p>some wisps of red-brown, taut glowing blush, reds glistening, surrounded by orange.</p>
<p>all was well, then JP started doing push-ups.</p>

<h2>03 19 2002 | dishes</h2>
<p>lots of dishes were washed &amp; the sink was cleaned. was that algae? it doesn't matter, i only broke one thing.</p>

<h2>03 18 2002 | i have heard that you cook</h2>
<p>everything is sleepiness.</p>

<h2>03 17 2002 | i saw ryan o'toole in maxim</h2>
<p>it is paul's birthday. pancakes &amp; oj &amp; sausage &amp; chili &amp; guitar-shaped magazine racks &amp; mike n' ikes! oh, and lots and lots of booze.</p>

<h2>03 16 2002 | (radio edit)</h2>
<p>there was really loud hip-hop blasting in the faces of old white people and an institution owned and run by old white-people and populated by the sons &amp; daughters of old white people. isn't that grand?</p>
<p>to read: kundera, fo, havel, carr, robbins, calvino, bantock</p>

<h2>03 15 2002 | yes, i'm still enduring freedom</h2>
<p>how vegan is it to buy a product processed on machines that also make dairy products? isn't that a stupid question? are you vegan because you don't want to support a cruel acts and those who perpetrate them, or because you can't handle the actual consumption of an animal product?</p>
<p>say, however, that you answer the former. then, would it still be vegan to buy something from a company that also produced non-vegan products?</p>
<p>what &#8230; the &#8230; fuck &#8230;</p>

<h2>03 14 2002 | cur-&gt;next-&gt;prev = cur-&gt;prev;</h2>
<p>programming data structures doesn't hurt anymore.</p>

<h2>03 13 2002 | no sleep</h2>
<p>didn't sleep. finished program. didn't draw. painted poorly. died on couch. in love with basename()</p>

<h2>03 12 2002 | anti-peace rally</h2>
<p>&#8220;they had a really big american flag, and a second small american flag. i think that second flag is what got their message across.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;yeah, fuck mole. they are a bunch of sellouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>so where are we coming from? can you trace back your own personal history? can you figure out why you think the way you do? once you do that, can you predict your own actions and words? could you choose to change all of that? can you refuse to be what you are? well? what the fuck?!?</p>

<h2>03 11 2002 | it's not monday anymore</h2>
<p>i spent pretty much all day programming. yeah. oh, and i got to hear about decomposing bodies, which was interesting, and i read a little about carpentry. here's to the noble fir!</p>

<h2>03 10 2002 | where did the koi &amp; lillies go?</h2>
<p>so there was bread and there was water and there was avacado and there was a bell pepper and there was spinach and there were sprouts and there was peppercorn tofurky, but there was no knife; a puzzle for you.</p>
<p>when there is a common history, it's odd &amp; uncomfortable to try to talk about anything else but sex toys, no?</p>
<p>a little bit of painting: rub&eacute;n is going to hate my work. it's because i'm lazy &amp; used mostly grays. i like grays, and so does ucsd. but mainly i like the blues.</p>
<p>do you ever feel wholly disconnected from what you're saying? it's really hard to talk to people when you can't even believe that you're forming coherent thoughts, or even thinking at all. you end up talking, but as you're talking, evaluating how you're talking and so on. a little too much self-awareness maybe.</p>
<p>aren't you curious what those little stars above are for? maybe you should click them.</p>

<h2>03 09 2002 | why can't i get that right?</h2>
<p>pink &amp; blue. flesh &amp; water. hand against the sky. sun bright. breeze. light clouds. warm concrete.</p>

<h2>03 08 2002 | vegans are so sexually repressed</h2>
<p>what do you get when you cross an apron with some strawberries with 18th-century "high tech" glasses with european mountain shoes with booze with medical-grade nitrous?</p>
<p>jesse, of course!</p>

<h2>03 07 2002 | neo-nazi architecture</h2>
<p>&#8220;there are other propositions for living that are at every moment possible&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;there was a cretin called JP Gorin who in 2001 expressed this theoryand that was me&#8221;</p>
<p>and at the risk of sounding like a sassy scenester, le tigre played tonight. yeah. and as kris says; there are things that need to happen.</p>

<h2>03 06 2002 | his moustache wasn't the only thing!</h2>

<h2>03 05 2002 | i didn't vote</h2>
<p>there are these subtle little things here or there that you don't notice because you're too damn preoccupied with trying to be something.</p>
<p>today i stared right in the eyes of someone who was trying to communicate with me, but gave no indication that i understood or cared or anything. i felt very uncomfortable doing something like that. nasty power plays.</p>
<!-- <p>i'll grin tomorrow if i have to stare at the pink corners of your mouth.</p> -->
<p>what does it mean if you can't remember someone's face to put to their words?</p>

<h2>03 04 2002 | it's your fucking body</h2>
<p>you are the cult of domesticity. propagating artificial needs. you have leather boots, with straps. you don't shower. you have a bottle of urine in the room. a large bottle. you flop about like a fish out of water.</p>

<h2>03 03 2002 | no pic-a-nic</h2>
<p>instead of lunching and arting, a few couch-toned ties appear. unfortunate sickness &amp; family troubles. consuming 'the turn of the screw' and 'daisy miller' tomorrow.</p>

<h2>03 02 2002 | do your taxes</h2>
<p>and there will be new stoves, new floors, new tables, new racks, new hooks, new lights, won't it be grand? art party, i think, perhaps action. there is not, unfortunately any real movement towards a new version/release which inhibits any of the more important uses of the system; packages must be up to date.</p>

<h2>03 01 2002 | mama's baby loves cornbread, cornbread&#8230;</h2>
<p>there are swirls on my wall from the glaze on the light fixture. surrounded by corn and flour and collard greens and potatos and sugar and onions and peppers. country songs &amp; cute children at the other food co-op. dinner time.</p>
<p>"lies are the words that i use when you look up hopefully"</p>

<h2>02 28 2002 | tie day!</h2>
<p>perpetual grime &amp; carelessness. smeared windows, grainy floors, pockmarked walls. and yet you'll do nothing about it. isn't it better to say nothing than to fill up the space with meaningless-ness?</p>

<h2>02 27 2002 | when i say guacamole&#8230;</h2>
<p>thoroughly pleasant. extra credit with my morning mangos. <a href="/old/">archives</a></p>

<h2>02 26 2002 | success</h2>
<p>it turns out everything of the below was fine, but i had mis-written other bits. shame on me. some grinning residue. irritated on all sides, though. too warm inside. how long before it is too long?</p>

<h2>02 26 2002 | yawn</h2>
<p>&amp;anagramStruct keeps jumping around, so how can i possibly expect bsearch to return anything useful? how aggravating.</p>
<pre>
searchResult = bsearch(&amp;anagramStruct,

               anagramCompare);</pre>

<h2>02 25 2002 | shining, of course</h2>
<p>a most embarassing situation to be put in, and by my own kin. nothing spectacular, except a glance here or there, but more than enough to make today worth my while. grinning. how can you best be represented by a bowl of mashed potatoes? or a pine cone for that matter? structure. form. shape. texture. all glistening.</p>

<h2>02 23 2002 | evening</h2>
<p>warm again. it's those same flashes of the sky through the eucalyptus. bureaucrats in the making, quizzing me on dollar signs. why does the car destroy the tracks like that when even the train doesn't? i don't understand the physics at work. disjointed sentences that make sense to me, but probably don't make good reading.</p>

<h2>02 23 2002 | morning</h2>
<p>and after a while you can work on points for style. like the club tie, and the firm handshake, a certain look in the eye, and an easy smile.</p>
<p>you have to be trusted by the people that you lie to so that when they turn their backs on you, you'll get the chance to put the knife in.</p>

<h2>02 22 2002 | warm, not fuzzy</h2>
<p>read new indicator (it's good!) fried corn fills me up and prevents me from consuming the other interesting items served this evening. this is of course quickly followed by donuts which may or may not be vegan, but which i trust to be, despite any evidence. also followed by a nice thick layer of crust, and crusty piercings. lo and behold, the grindcore ta has begun hosting an unfulfilling class section. pfft to that indeed.</p>
<p>after the meeting this evening i chatted with chris-chan about presidential matters and the issues facing the global industrial-corporate-capitalist agenda. we concluded, with some info from jake, that all of the right wing is evil, that most of the left wing is evil, and therefore no one can be trusted to say or do anything with any degree of secrecy or assurance that their task will be completed.</p>

<h2>02 21 2002 | are you under 13?</h2>
<p>2 hours of "pornography" culminating in the autoerotic asphyxiation of a handsome japanese man and the removal of his genitals. all in a day's work for the frenchman. <!-- brightly colored bandanas and braids. --> sketching at work. sweet potato candies. sneering at currie for the chance to eat carrot-like sweet potatos &amp; broccoli. i am full of contempt for you. hey look at me, i'm cool cuz i don't capitalize my words.</p>
